Welcome to my blog! I am an electrical engineer, an active hobbyist and an GNU Emacs fan. Keen on Systems Engineering & Functional Programming. Right now I am working as a IC System Architect [[https://www.melexis.com][@Melexis]]

I have evaluated many blog technology options, the shortlist included Jekyll, HUGO, ox-hugo, but the final call is pure org blogging with html
export.
