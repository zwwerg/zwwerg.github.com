#+DESCRIPTION: 3d printer setup and information

This post is about my 3D printer and detailed description about the customizations
I have done.

* Printer base
#+INDEX: 3dprint!Prusa

My base printer is an original Prusa i3 MK3S+, that I ordered in KIT.
At the time of buying the version was MK3 only, but I kept up with the updates
released by Prusa Research.

* Customizations

I have done many customizations to improve the printing experience, and for
fun, too.

*** Notes:

The bear upgrade is not necessary, it does not contribute to print quality,
as I find the original Prusa frame sturdy enough. Although I liked it, because
it allows easier mount of utils and tools to the frame.

The concrete base is a must have, as it is cheap, and makes the printer
vibrate much less.

The camera I don't recommend, any USB camera with raspberry compatibility
would do.

The enclosure is a good idea even if you don't print with ABS, as it keeps
the printer relatively dust free. The LED strip is switchable, I keep it
on only for problematic prints that I want to monitor through the camera and
octopi. I've installed always-on-LEDs on the camera, too, these keep
a minimum light so that one can tell whether the print has issues through
octopi.

The whole printer is elevated, adjusted to my height, so I don't need to lean
forward, but access the printer in a stand-up posture.
