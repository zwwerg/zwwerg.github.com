#+DESCRIPTION: 3d print project

This post is about a small 3D print project.

* Background
#+INDEX: 3dprint!Swatch

A friend asked me to help printing a replacment part (pin of the buckle) of a
Swatch watch strap.

* Design files

I've considered the two freely available Thingiverse designs:

[[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4170947][Flik Flak Buckle and Pin]]

out of which I've used the pin from the first one.

* Prints and results
#+INDEX: 3dprint!PC

I have printed 12 samples, using the [[https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/prusament/1258-prusament-pc-blend-natural-1kg.html][PC - strongest - filament]], from Prusa [fn:1].

The results are satisfying, considering the costs [fn:2] and the fact that Swatch does not
provide neither pin nor buckle replacement, only full strap replacement.

* Summary

In case of need of a pin replacement, feel free to contact me on the above links.
